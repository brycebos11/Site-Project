SQL FILES:

Inside the sql scripts folder you will find the sql files necessary to build the proper tables for this site.

There is also a little bit of data that is added to each table for reference and use.

THE TEST MAIL SERVER SETUP PROGRAM:

This is an exceedingly simple program that the site is setup to use. Just install (very small footprint), click the 
"test mail server tool" icon that apprears on your desktop, make sure that the port is set to 25 and the "path to 
store received email" can be anywhere you choose.

This is used if you want to test the email feature of the site. When you are done registering, an email will be sent 
out immediately to the email address that you provided, along with a message from the webmaster.

EVERYTHING ELSE:

All other files are ready for use. Just copy and paste the train folder inside your xampp/htdocs folder and you are ready.

You can reach the first page by typing: localhost/train

LOGIN:

If you want to skip registration and go straight to the members only page, then you can login with these credentials:

username: username, password: password

KNOWN BUGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FIXED:

* After the home page, the "body" background color in the CSS doesn't seem to register.

* When going from the members only section back to the home page (all links redirect back to the home page), 
the styles for the home page are all out of whack.

* The email has several symbols in the message that are not supposed to be there. After doing some research, it looks 
like this happens often when someone is trying to test their own emails.

* The link in the email does not really take you to the "first time login" page. Instead it directs you to the login page.
